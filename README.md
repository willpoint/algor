# algor

### *Algorithms*, *explanations*, and more in **go**.

### NOTE: *This is a work in progress*

## For each algorithm presented in each package. The preceding comment would contain the following:

-   **Name** of algorithm.
-   **Description** - a high level overview of what the algorithm is designed to achieve.
- **Performance** - the worse, average and best case to be expected.
-   **Solution** - written in **go**.
-   **Discussion** - covering the pros and cons of the algorithm. When it would make a difference to choose it. and so on.
- **Tests** - showing the algorithm in action, in some cases, a benchmark comparing similar algorithms.

As there is practically no way to avoid mentioning data structures in a discussion of algorithms. A package for data structures `ds` would be updated as the need arises.
