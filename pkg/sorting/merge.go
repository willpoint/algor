package sorting

// Merge algorithm to the wikipedia article on merge sort
// This algorithm consists of two steps
// 1. Recursively, dividing the input list[slice|array]
// into sublist[...] of roushly equal length, until each
// contains only one element. a list containing a `single`
// which by definition is sorted
// 2. Repeatedly merge merge sublists to create a new sublist
// until the single list contains all elements.
// The single list is the sorted list
