### *Data Structures & Algorithms* in **go**.

#### *This is a work in progress* and ideas are welcome

### For each data structure and algorithm presented in `pkg`, the comments would contain the following:

-   **Name** of data structure / algorithm.
-   **Description** - a high level overview of what the algorithm is designed to achieve.
-   **Performance** - the worse, average and best case to be expected in the case of an algorithm
-   **Tests** - showing the data structure / algorithm in action. And for argument's sake, a benchmark comparing similar algorithms.
