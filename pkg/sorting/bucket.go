package sorting

// BucketSort seeks to do a complete
// sorting without making A[0, n) comparisons
// thereby having a linear time complexity
// in the best, average and worst case.
// This comes at the cost of space and as a consequence
// should be used when space is of no concern
func BucketSort(b []byte) []byte {
	return b
}
